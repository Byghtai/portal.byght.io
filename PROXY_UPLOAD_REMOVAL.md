# Proxy Upload Fallback Removal

## Overview
The proxy upload fallback mechanism has been completely removed from the application. All files are now uploaded directly to Hetzner S3 using presigned URLs.

## Changes Made

### 1. AdminPanel.jsx
- **Removed**: Proxy upload fallback logic for files â‰¤5MB
- **Removed**: `MAX_PROXY_SIZE` constant and related checks
- **Simplified**: Error handling now only shows CORS configuration instructions
- **Updated**: Error messages to focus on CORS configuration requirements

### 2. Netlify Functions
- **Deleted**: `netlify/functions/admin-upload-proxy.js` - No longer needed
- **Kept**: `admin-get-upload-url.js` - Still required for presigned URL generation
- **Kept**: `admin-confirm-upload.js` - Still required for upload confirmation

### 3. Documentation Updates
- **Updated**: `S3_CORS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Removed proxy upload references
- **Updated**: `LARGE_FILE_UPLOAD.md` - Simplified architecture description
- **Created**: This file documenting the changes

## Benefits

### Performance
- **Faster uploads**: No proxy overhead through Netlify Functions
- **Lower latency**: Direct S3 communication
- **Better bandwidth utilization**: No double transfer through Netlify

### Reliability
- **Simplified error handling**: No complex fallback logic
- **Clearer error messages**: Focus on CORS configuration
- **Reduced failure points**: Fewer components in upload chain

### Cost
- **Lower Netlify costs**: No proxy bandwidth usage
- **Reduced function invocations**: Only URL generation and confirmation
- **Better resource utilization**: Direct S3 uploads

## Requirements

### CORS Configuration
All S3 buckets must have proper CORS configuration:

```json
{
  "CORSRules": [
    {
      "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
      "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE", "HEAD", "OPTIONS"],
      "AllowedOrigins": [
        "https://portal-byght-io.netlify.app",
        "https://portal.byght.io",
        "http://localhost:5173",
        "http://localhost:3000"
      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": [
        "ETag",
        "x-amz-server-side-encryption",
        "x-amz-request-id",
        "x-amz-id-2",
        "Content-Length",
        "Content-Type"
      ],
      "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Handling
When uploads fail, users will see clear error messages directing them to:
1. Check CORS configuration on S3 bucket
2. Verify S3 endpoint and credentials
3. Retry the upload

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Deployments
- No database changes required
- No environment variable changes needed
- Existing files remain accessible
- Upload functionality will work immediately after deployment

### For New Deployments
- Ensure CORS is configured before first upload
- Test with small files first
- Monitor upload success rates

## Testing

### Recommended Test Cases
1. **Small files** (< 1MB): Verify direct upload works
2. **Medium files** (1-50MB): Test progress tracking
3. **Large files** (50-100MB): Verify size limit handling
4. **CORS errors**: Test error message clarity
5. **Network issues**: Test retry functionality

### Success Indicators
- Console shows: "File uploaded to S3 successfully"
- Progress bar reaches 100%
- File appears in file list immediately
- No proxy-related console messages

### Failure Indicators
- Console shows: "S3 direct upload failed - likely CORS issue"
- Clear error message about CORS configuration
- Upload progress stops with error status
